Trained MaskRCNN on my own dataset (shoes) . I chose VGG image anotator as my annotation tool and i had 1 label/class shoe, 
i labelled them manually and then i exported the data as .json format which is very popular. then i chose Detectron2 as my rcnn training and evaluator. 
i had 20 images for training and 5 for validation.
